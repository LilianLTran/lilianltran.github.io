                Jubensha is a social deduction game where players take on 
                characters in a mystery story and work together to uncover 
                hidden truths. Through discussion, reasoning, and 
                interpretation of clues, the narrative gradually unfolds.

              <p className="mt-2">
                What fascinates me most is the balance between deduction and 
                creativity. Playing a character requires seeing the world from 
                perspectives different from our own, and through that process 
                of reasoning and empathy we often uncover insights about people 
                and stories that we might otherwise overlook. Those insights 
                are not limited to the game itself—they often help us 
                understand the real world more deeply.

          I’m drawn to hobbies that combine creativity with structure.
          Whether building software or participating in narrative games,
          I enjoy systems where thoughtful design shapes the experience.
